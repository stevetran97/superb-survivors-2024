title=Superb Survivor  2024 BETA (SP Only)
description=[h2]What is different about this branch[/h2]
description=This is a standalone duplicate of my other Superb Survivors Continued mod. In this branch I will be aggressively trying to rewrite and optimize the code. This branch will be expected to be unstable.

description=
description=[h2]Optimizations[/h2]
description=1. Most Survivors AI routine is now updated every 60 ticks (once per second when running 60fps) -  Previously every 20 ticks - To improve performance.
description=2. Combat performance nerfed to update once every 20 ticks (3 times per second on 60fps) -  Previously every 10 ticks - Improve performance and slightly nerf AI melee combat.
description=3. Reworked All AI Routines - Moved routines to every 10 min, hourly, and daily to prevent redundant status updates every second
description=4. Reworked Vision - Survivors ignore zombies on higher levels. Optimised distance cap to reduce number of seen entities processed. Reduced vision distance calcs to 2D in most cases because height dimension is redundant. Used built in function to reduce the average amount of zombies processed from hundreds to a few dozen on average.
description=5. Removed redundant and overlapping procedures in the task manager. There were multiple AI protocols which were being performed excessively to 'brute force' the ai to work better in certain situations. This made it really hard to precisely control how the ai should perform in certain situations. Also it was extra processing.

description=[h2]Other[/h2]
description=1. Survivors can now show up with M16, M14, and shotguns.

description=[h2]Bug fixes[/h2]
description=1. Better FPS compatibility - added a NPC spawn distance option. Spawn distances greater than 30 will actually cause npcs not to spawn when using Potato PC configuration of Better FPS mod. This is because NPCs cannot be loaded outside of the cell that the player has loaded in.
description=2. Fixed memory leak where survivor was unable to climb out of a window due to out of index bug - This was causing thousands of accumulating errors per stuck survivors

description=
description=[h2]Recommended Optimizations[/h2]
description=0. Inside of your main save folder at Saves/sandbox/[name of your save], this mod will create files starting with the name 'Survivor'. Currently this accumulates infinitely and I am working on fixing it. You can delete this to reset your Survivors mod in the save and reduce lag.
description=1. Allocate more Ram  - Add this to ProjectZomboid64.json. and ProjectZomboid64.bat. Replace the equivalent -Xmx... and -Xms... with
description=-Xmx12g
description=-Xms6g
description=Make sure both are added. Xms determines Ram usage. Xmx determines max available memory.
description=
description=2. Run maximum of ~8 - 10 Npcs
description=3. Render less zombies at any one time - less in total or using Better FPS mod.
description=4. Do not run the mod with standardized xp mods - Maybe? I notice some more lag
description=5. Do a youtube tutorial to improve gaming performance
description=6. Avoid more than 6x total pop (especially in louisville) - Survivor AI have to see and process each zombie every update.
description=7. Play with everyone is infected - There is no way of cleaning up dead uninfected npcs. They can only be cleaned up if they die and zombify
description=8. Change Zombie clothing to simple. Reduce max texture size to 256 or 512. Turn off blood decals.
description=9. For Desperate Measures - Cap your frame rate to 30-45 FPS. This mod updates the survivor routines for all survivors once per frame.
